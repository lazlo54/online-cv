    summary: |
      I'm currently a student in the ionian university of informatics. I have been
      following classes for 3 years. I have no prier job expiriance however I have 
      worked on projects that were facinating to me as kid, for example virtual games 
      and mostly action/shooting games. In the past years i have done a number of 
      different projects that were assigned to us. These projects were from strict 
      codding in an attempt to learn the codding process and the language itself. 
      Also there were projects that were directed more to a creative side of the
      current subject.

        Currently studying in the ionian university in the department of informatics. I have a passion for creative problem 
        solving, so programming is a fun activity for me most of the time. Mostly when i complete stuff that work flawlessly.
        I'm at the 3rd year of a 4 year study program. I have learnd a lot of stuff at programming but also in computer graphics,
        databasses, and more stuff on how the software of a computer works and more like that.
